# Description of the assignment
Our groups Music Visualizer compiles a montage of different visuals all inspired by the song "Eyelar" by Fred Again. The song was split into parts which transition using an in-built timer. These parts/animation showcase our creative and technical skills for object oriented programming in Java, as part of this music visualier project.

# Instructions
press fn + f5 and watch the code on VSC, also press spacebar and it begins.
or watch it here on Youtube: https://youtu.be/dfZdfHreKV8

# How it works
### Timer
A timing system used throughout the program that dictates which visuals play at which time. Depending on the time set.

### Stars
We used a background(0) to create a black background and created a star class, this star class was then used to create stars in a for loop using a speed set by smoothedAmplitude.

### Eyelar intro
We used text that came letter by letter for eyelar using if and if else statements

### Solar system
We used ellipses that rotate using a theta variable and translate() to create planets that rotate around one big planet

### Horizon Vertex
We used vertexes to create an animation of a blue horizon as if you are speeding through the horizon. The vertexes took parameters that changed in a for loop to create the animation.

### Eye
The eye is quite similiar to the vertex, we took in different parameters for the eye that changed the animation in a for loop. Also, there were 3 stars moving in random directions that only became visible when infront of the blue in the eye.

### Eyelar Outro
It is similiar also to the horizon vertex, the circles were removed and it gradually faded to the starry night alone again then into a black screen to finish the visuals off. The horizon was also made thinner.

# What we are most proud of in the assignment
- Working together as a team to overcome obstacles and to gain a sense of what it will feel like to work in coding teams in an internship next year (hopefully).
- How creative we became with coming up with and implementing the different visual animations with the music.
- How well the animations worked together all being linked by a starry night and a blue pallet of colours.
- Gaining a greater understanding of java processing systems.
