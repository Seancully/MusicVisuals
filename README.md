# Description of the assignment
Our groups Music Visualizer compiles a montage of different visuals all inspired by the song "Eyelar" by Fred Again. The song was split into parts which transition using an in-built timer. These parts/animation showcase our creative and technical skills for object oriented programming in Java, as part of this music visualier project.

# Instructions
press fn + f5 and watch the code on VSC, also press spacebar and it begins.
or watch it here on Youtube: https://youtu.be/dfZdfHreKV8

# Each team member or individual needs to write a paragraph or two explaining what they contributed to the project
## Sean:
### WHAT I DID:
I created a solar system animation where planets rotate as if they are in space rotating around a centre point. It acts as though you should feel the mood and atmosphere of the music to be quite calming. This fits the solar system animation quite well.
### WHAT IM MOST PROUD OF:
- Working together as a team to overcome obstacles and to gain a sense of what it will feel like to work in coding teams in an internship next year (hopefully).
- How creative we became with coming up with and implementing the different visual animations with the music.
- How well the animations worked together all being linked by a starry night and a blue pallet of colours.
- Gaining a greater understanding of java processing systems.
- How I learned to yse translation and also pushMatrix(0 and popMatrix() for the planets transformations.
### WHAT I LEARNED:
- How to cause the planets to rotate around a centre pont using the translate() and also the rotate() method using a 'theta' variable 
- How other functions in Java Processing work such as pushMatrix(0 and popMatrix(), also experimented with 
- How to be creative, and work around issues by testing code repeatedly and coming up with new designs and implementing them too.

# How it works
### Timer
A timing system used throughout the program that dictates which visuals play at which time. Depending on the time set.

### Stars
We used a background(0) to create a black background and created a star class, this star class was then used to create stars in a for loop using a speed set by smoothedAmplitude.

### Eyelar intro
We used text that came letter by letter for eyelar using if and if else statements

### Solar system
We used ellipses that rotate using a theta variable and translate() to create planets that rotate around one big planet

### Horizon Vertex
We used vertexes to create an animation of a blue horizon as if you are speeding through the horizon. The vertexes took parameters that changed in a for loop to create the animation.

### Eye
The eye is quite similiar to the vertex, we took in different parameters for the eye that changed the animation in a for loop. Also, there were 3 stars moving in random directions that only became visible when infront of the blue in the eye.

### Eyelar Outro
It is similiar also to the horizon vertex, the circles were removed and it gradually faded to the starry night alone again then into a black screen to finish the visuals off. The horizon was also made thinner.
